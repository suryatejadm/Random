# Random
 The Random Password Generator creates secure passwords based on user preferences for length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters). It uses Pythonâ€™s randomization and string libraries for flexibility and reliability. This project is ideal for learning basic programming concepts while improving password security.
